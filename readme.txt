This plugin generates an XML file using content from multiple blog posts. You decide how many of the latest posts you want included in the XML file. You can use the generated XML files to populate photo gallery software, iPhone applications, etc. Using the options page, you can decide how many posts to display, what content you want to include, what to name the surrounding XML tags, and whether or not you want to pull from only one category or all categories.

== Description ==
After installing and activating the plugin, the XML file is generated simply by visiting your site's front page. The file generates each time someone visits your site's front page. This shouldn't be an issue with server overload, unless you get a LOT of traffic. If you notice slowness due to this plugin, let me know.

The XML generated will be located in a folder called 'xmlfiles' within your wp-content folder. The file will be named multipost.xml.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip and upload files to your plugins directory.
2. Activate. You can tell the plugin is working by visiting your site, then visiting http://www.yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-content/xmlfiles/multipost.xml.
3. Choose your settings in the "XML-ify Wordpress Multiple Posts" options page in the Wordpress admin area.
